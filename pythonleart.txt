Class student

Sepecial objects : start from __1__ 
Object: refer to class and can access its functions.

def __init__ ( self, name ) : # Self is a required first parameter , it passes the object it self name should be passed values 
 self.name = name
 self.attend = 0
 
 
 I can creat object of the class and access it but for that i need to pass parameter also 
 
 s1 = student("Patrick")
 
 s1.name
 s1.attend
 
 Second is functions
 
 def attendday(self) 
 
 self.attend =1            ££ here self.attend is described below the class
 
 Now 
 s1 = student('Patrick')
 s1.attendday()
 s1.attend
 
 
 Example 
 
 Class student :
 
 def __init__ (self, name)  
 self.name = name
 self.grades= []
 self. attendance = 1
 
 def addgrade(self,grade)
 self.grades.append(grade)
 
 
 """"" Number 2 method '''''
def population()
print xyz

we can access only through the class not through object student.population()
